How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
  The way I interpret the user needs and implement them is by evaluating the project. This is accomplished by holding a team meeting (SCRUM) during which time all the requirements are laid out. The use of user stories during this time help to understand the perspective of the user, and hopefully put out a product that of top quality for the user. 
How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
  I approach developing programs using the Agile method. The process that I will continue to incoperate into future development programs would be (but not limited to) the sprint.
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
  To be a good team member, one must be good at communication, both giving feeedback as well as taking it. Once must alo be able to work as a team, not be a lone wolf per say. There are amny facets to being a good team member, overall, you should be a decent person who is willing to give your best to the team every day.
